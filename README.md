- Change default kernel
- Install graphics (Intel, NVIDIA, AMD)
- Add and remove regular or admin users
- Install dekstop environments
- Install i3WM only or with custom apps
- Install premade configs for i3WM
- Set up KVM/QEMU passthrough ready virtual machines (Beta) [Intel only at this point]

#### With git
- Install and sync git: `pacman -Sy git`
